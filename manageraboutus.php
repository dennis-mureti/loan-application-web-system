We seek to minimize on the time spent by the client while going to apply for a loan. This will be more applicable for aperson that stays far away from the SACCO offices itself. So waste no time and sign up to the system after communicating with your SACCO first. Borrow loan save time. The user can also view the loan application as it is being processed to see if it is accepted or rejected.</p>
		<p class="dark">The system will not only be used by the clients alone. The SACCO itself need see the person and the loans applied for. The SACCO manager can also sign up into the system to be able to update on the different loans appied for. This also saves time for you as the manger to go perform other daily duties. Why wait for all thoseforms while you can still update the loans from here. The manager can also update the different loan application in the case of future changes or the loan applicant changes their minds on something.</p>
